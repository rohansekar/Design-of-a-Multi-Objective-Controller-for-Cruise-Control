• Modelled a system by emulating real world conditions.
• Compared the responses of a PID and a Fuzzy-PID controller in a cruise control system.
• The controller that gave the better response was used to construct a multi-objective controller.The
multi-objective controller was designed using MATLAB Simulink and Python.
• A Kalman Filter was also implemented to estimate the speed of the vehicle and to filter out the disturbances.


Instructions to run the Fuzzy-PID controller:

-Upload the Fuzzy.fis file to the Fuzzy Logic Controller and se the values of the model as A=0.0276, B=8.333e-4, C=1 and D=0.
